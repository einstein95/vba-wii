## Wii ##

The most popular method of running homebrew on the Wii is through the [Homebrew Channel](http://hbc.hackmii.com/). If you already have the channel installed, just copy over the apps folder included in the archive into the root of your SD card.

Remember to also create the vbagx directory structure required (a sample structure is included in the archive).

For more detailed instructions, see [Wiibrew](http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/Visual_Boy_Advance_GX).

## GameCube ##

You can load Visual Boy Advance GX via sdload and an SD card in slot A, or by streaming
it to your Gamecube, or by making a bootable DVD.
